### 문제 설명

<p>As part of an arithmetic competency program, your students will be given randomly generated lists of from 2 to 15 unique positive integers and asked to determine how many items in each list are twice some other item in the same list. You will need a program to help you with the grading. This program should be able to scan the lists and output the correct answer for each one. For example, given the list</p>

<p>1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22</p>

<p>your program should answer 3, as 2 is twice 1, 4 is twice 2, and 18 is twice 9.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input file will consist of one or more lists of numbers. There will be one list of numbers per line. Each list will contain from 2 to 15 unique positive integers. No integer will be larger than 99. Each line will be terminated with the integer 0, which is not considered part of the list. A line with the single number -1 will mark the end of the file. The example input below shows 3 separate lists. Some lists may not contain any doubles.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output will consist of one line per input list, containing a count of the items that are double some other item.</p>
