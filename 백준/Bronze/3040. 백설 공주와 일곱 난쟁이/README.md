### 문제 설명

<p>Every day, while the dwarves are busy in the mines, Snow White prepares dinner for them; seven chairs, seven plates, seven forks and seven knives for seven hungry dwarves. </p>

<p>One day nine dwarves came from the mines instead of seven (nobody knows how or why), each of them claiming to be one of Snow White's seven dwarves. </p>

<p>Luckily, each dwarf wears a hat with a positive integer less than 100 written on it. Snow White, a famous mathematician, realised long ago that the sum of numbers on the hats of her seven dwarves was exactly 100. </p>

<p>Write a program which determines which dwarves are legit, i.e. pick seven of nine numbers that add to 100. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>There are 9 lines of input. Each contains an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). All of the numbers will be distinct. </p>

<p>Note: The test data will be such that the solution is unique. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program must produce exactly seven lines of output – the numbers on the hats of Snow White's seven dwarves. Output the numbers in any order.</p>
