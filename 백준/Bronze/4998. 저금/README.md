### 문제 설명

<p>Suppose you open a savings account with a certain initial balance. You will not make any withdrawals or further deposits for a number of years. The bank will compound your balance (add the annual interest) once a year, on the anniversary of the opening of the account. Your goal is to achieve a certain target amount in your savings account. In how may years will the target amount be achieved? </p>

These will be positive numbers; they may or may not contain a decimal point. The target amount will be greater than the initial balance. The input is terminated by end-of-file</p>
