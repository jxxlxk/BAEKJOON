### 문제 설명

<p>You have been assigned the task of writing down all numbers starting at N up to and including M, and report back the number of times you had to write a zero. You realize that you don’t really need to write down all the numbers to do this. Write a program that calculates the number of zeroes you need to write, so you can save yourself from getting writing cramps.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer, T, the number of test cases. Each case is given on a separate line and consists of the two integers N and M separated by a space.</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 ≤ T ≤ 20</li>
	<li>0 ≤ N ≤ M ≤ 1,000,000</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output the number of zeroes you had to write to write down all the numbers.</p>
