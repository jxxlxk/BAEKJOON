### 문제 설명

<p>Gandalf has been trying to read ancient Elvish texts to better understand the history of the One Ring. One of the texts that he has un(middle)earthed looks promising; however, an enchantment appears to have scrambled the letters in each word. For example, “sauron” may have been scrambled to “uosanr”, “isildur” may have been scrambled to “druiisl” and son on. The number of letters and the frequency of letters in a word remains unchanged. Two such strings are called anagrams.</p>

<p>Help Gandalf decipher the text by giving him an oracle that can tell if any two words are anagrams.</p>
