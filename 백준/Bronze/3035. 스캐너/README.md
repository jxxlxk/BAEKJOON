### 문제 설명

<p>Having solved the match issue, Mirko faced another challenging problem. His mom ordered him to read an article about the newest couples on the Croatian show-biz scene in the "Moja Tajna" magazine. The article is written in a very small font size which Mirko cannot read. Luckily, Mirko has a scanner in the closet which will enlarge the article for him. </p>

<p>The article is a matrix of characters with R rows and C columns. The characters are letters of the English alphabet, digits and the character '.' (period). Mirko's scanner supports two parameters, ZR and ZC. It substitutes each character it scans with a matrix of ZR rows and ZC columns, where all entries are equal to the scanned character. </p>

<p>Mirko realized his scanner's software no longer works so he needs your help. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first row contains four integers, R, C, ZR and ZC. R and C are between 1 and 50, while ZR and ZC are between 1 and 5. </p>

<p>Each of the following R rows contains C characters each, representing the article from "Moja Tajna". </p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should be a matrix of characters with R·ZR rows and C·ZC columns, the enlarged article. </p>

<p> </p>
