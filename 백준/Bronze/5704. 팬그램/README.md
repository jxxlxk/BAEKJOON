### 문제 설명

<p>“Pangram Show” is an exciting new television quiz show which oﬀers very large cash prizes for correctly detecting if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram is a sentence that contains at least once each of all 26 letters of the English alphabet.</p>

<p>Pangram examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog</li>
	<li>jackdaws loves my big sphinx of quartz</li>
</ul>

<p>Each contestant must indicate if each sentence is a pangram or not. During the ACM Contest, you may play along with actual contestants from the show! You’ll be given the same sentences as they appeared on the show. Can you do as well as the contestant?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is given in a single line that contains a non-empty string of at most 200 characters. Each string represents a sentence. The words of the sentence are separated with a single space. Only lowercase letters of the English alphabet and spaces appear in each line of the input.</p>

<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing a single asterisk.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case your program must output a single line, containing an uppercase ‘Y’ if the sentence is a pangram or an uppercase ‘N’ if the sentence is not a pangram.</p>
