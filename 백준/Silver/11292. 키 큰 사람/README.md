### 문제 설명

<p>When I was at school, we were always very competitive; who can run fastest? Who gets best marks in tests? This problem gets you to help with one such challenge – who is tallest?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a number of groups of people. The first line for each group contains a single integer, N, which is the number of people in the group. (0 < N <= 50). If N is 0, this marks the end of input.</p>

<p>N lines then follow, each containing data on one person, a single name followed by a height in metres which has 2 decimal places.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each group of people, output a single line containing the name of the tallest person. Where two or more people in a group have the same height, list each of them on the same line, separated by spaces, in the order they appear in the input.</p>
